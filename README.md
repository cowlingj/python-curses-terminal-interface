# python-curses-terminal-interface
An terminal like interface made in python using curses.
It's like an old school dumb terminal, in the sense that it does nothing with the string that it is passed,
that is the job of any program using the interface.

## Usage
create a CursesApplication object and use the two methods supplied **__getMessage()__** and **__setResponse(text_to_output)__**.
